## What is Indexing Bookmarks and Web Pages

Unlike other simple bookmark management and search tools, MemFree generates intelligent "vector indexes" for your bookmarks and web content. This technology acts like creating a "mind map" for each bookmark, recording their meaning and relevance. So, when you search for any question or sentence, **MemFree can find the most matching and similar bookmarks and web content based on their semantics (i.e., actual meaning)**.

For example, if you search for "best hybrid AI search engine" in MemFree, it will not only find bookmarks with those keywords in the title but also those related to AI search content, even if the title doesn't explicitly mention it. This approach makes searches smarter and more efficient, providing you with more precise and relevant information.

## Why Index Bookmarks and Web Pages

1. Even the world's largest traditional search engine, Google, only indexes a small fraction of web pages globally (estimated to be around 5%).
2. Even if Google does index it, the likelihood of finding the exact content you want directly on the first page of Google search results is very low.
3. For the bookmarks and web pages you specifically index in MemFree, **MemFree will prioritize these during searches, using vector indexing to return the most similar content, and ultimately providing the best answer through its AI model**.
4. For web pages that you find valuable or interesting, you just need to let MemFree index them with one click. MemFree will become your second brain, eliminating the need for you to remember specifics. Later, **when you want to retrieve information from indexed web pages, MemFree will provide you with the precise answers you need**.

By leveraging this approach, MemFree not only smartly and efficiently manages and searches your bookmarks and web pages but also ensures you can always quickly locate the information you require, whether it's tucked away somewhere online or stored in your personal collection.
