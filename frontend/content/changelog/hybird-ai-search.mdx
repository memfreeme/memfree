Today, MemFree supports Hybrid AI Search

### What is Hybrid AI Search?

Hybrid AI Search involves simultaneously performing searches on your personal knowledge base (such as bookmarks, notes, documents, etc.) and the Internet.
This approach enables the retrieval of context that best matches your question, allowing a large AI model to provide the most accurate answer possible.

### Why do you need Hybrid AI Search?

1. **Personalization**: The search results are tailored to your personal knowledge base, which is more relevant to you.
2. **Efficiency**: You can quickly find the information you need without having to search multiple sources.
3. **Accuracy**: The AI model can provide more accurate answers by considering both your personal knowledge base and the Internet.
4. **Real-time Updates**: Provides access to the latest information through Internet searches, ensuring timeliness and relevance.

As shown in the figure, I first indexed the webpage https://www.memfree.me/blog/memfree-build-1-why, so when I ask Why Build MemFree, Hybrid AI Search will first consider the content of the memfree blog,
and then consider various content searched from the Internet.

Now, you can ask any questions and get the most accurate answers from MemFree Hybrid AI Search. Enjoy!
