Web page analysis is necessary for any website, so we must choose a powerful, easy-to-use, cost-effective web page analysis tool from Iverson.
After using and evaluating multiple web analytics tools, memfree finally chose Clarity

## Why MemFree choose Clarity

1. Which is free
2. The UI is simple and clear

## Why not Google Analytics

1. The UI is complex and difficult to use

## Why not Vercel Analytics, Plausible and Umami

1. Which isn't free and cost is high

## How clarity integrated with NextJS

Add the following code to your layout.tsx file in app root dir.

```js
<Script id="clarity-script" strategy="afterInteractive">
    {`
            (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
                c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
                t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
                y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
            })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID}");
          `}
</Script>
```

    Updated on June 15th: After a few days of trying Clarity, I found that Clarity's data was not updated in a timely manner, so I finally tried Cloudflare Web
    Analytics. Because the analysis indicators provided by Cloudflare Web Analytics are enough for me, the data is updated in a timely manner, and it is also
    free.

## How Cloudflare Web Analytics integrated with NextJS 14

Only need to add the following code to your layout.tsx file in app root dir.

```js
<Script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "xxxxx"}'></Script>
```
