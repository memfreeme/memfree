## Deploying a Static Next.js App on Cloudflare Pages

Deploying a static Next.js application on Cloudflare Pages is straightforward. You can accomplish this with just a few commands by following the guide on [Cloudflare's documentation for deploying a static Next.js site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/deploy-a-static-nextjs-site/).

To validate this process, I first extracted the React review feature from the MemFree AI Page Generator and deployed it as a standalone webpage: [React Shadcn UI Preview](https://reactshadcn.com/).

The entire deployment process was smooth, with minimal obstacles encountered.

## Deploying MemFree AI Page Generator on Cloudflare

You can experience the online version here: [PageGen - AI Page Generator](https://pagegen.ai/).

1. Challenge 1: All APIs Support for Edge Runtime

2. Challenge 2: All Dynamic Pages Support for Edge Runtime

## Specific Cloudflare Page Edge Compatibility Issues

### 1. Custom Format Replacement for `util.format`

To ensure compatibility with the edge environment, replace the `util.format` function with the following implementation:

```ts
// Replace the util.format function with this one; this method works in the edge environment
export function format(template, ...args) {
    if (args.length === 0) return template;

    if (args.length === 1 && typeof args[0] === 'object') {
        return template.replace(/%[sdj]/g, (match) => String(args[0]));
    }

    let index = 0;
    return template.replace(/%[sdj]/g, () => {
        if (index >= args.length) return '';
        const arg = args[index++];
        return String(arg);
    });
}
```

### 2. Replace `@upstash/redis` with `@upstash/redis/cloudflare`

Using `@upstash/redis` directly may result in the following error:

```ts
Failed to get searches: Error: The 'cache' field on 'RequestInitializerDict' is not implemented
```

To resolve this, simply replace the import statement:

```ts
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis/cloudflare';
```

No other code modifications are necessary.

### 3. Replace `pdfjs` with `unpdf`

The `pdfjs` library, widely used for PDF parsing, is incompatible with the edge environment. If you attempt to use `pdfjs`, you may encounter the following errors during deployment:

```ts
⚡️ Unexpected error: Build failed with 4 errors:
⚡️ <stdin>:883:64363: ERROR: Could not resolve "fs"
⚡️ <stdin>:883:64423: ERROR: Could not resolve "http"
⚡️ <stdin>:883:64450: ERROR: Could not resolve "https"
⚡️ <stdin>:883:64476: ERROR: Could not resolve "url"
```

The reason for these errors is that the edge environment does not support certain Node.js modules. The solution is to use [unpdf](https://github.com/unjs/unpdf) instead.

### 4. Replace `uploadthing` with R2

`uploadthing` is a component designed to simplify client-side file uploads across various frameworks, but it does not support the Cloudflare edge environment.

When using Cloudflare Pages or Workers, you can easily upload files to R2 with just a few lines of code, benefiting from free CDN acceleration:

```ts
const res = await getRequestContext().env.IMAGES.put(safeFileName, file);
```

### 5. Use Static Variables Instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC` Environment Variables

In Cloudflare's Next-on-Pages, `NEXT_PUBLIC` environment variables cannot be accessed directly. You can replace them with static variables instead.

### 6. Replace `contentlayer2` with `next/mdx`

The documentation and blog sections of MemFree were generated using `contentlayer2` based on MDX files. However, using `contentlayer2` in Cloudflare Next-on-Pages results in the following error:

```ts
EvalError: Code generation from strings disallowed for this context
```

The reason for the error with contentlayer2 is that it uses the Function constructor, which is not allowed in edge environments.

```ts
export const getMDXComponent = (code: string, globals: Record<string, unknown> = {}): React.FC<MDXContentProps> => {
    const scope = { React, ReactDOM, _jsx_runtime, ...globals };
    const fn = new Function(...Object.keys(scope), code);
    return fn(...Object.values(scope)).default;
};

export const useMDXComponent = (code: string, globals: Record<string, unknown> = {}) => {
    return React.useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code, globals), [code, globals]);
};
```

However, this is actually unnecessary because static pages can be fully generated during the build process without the need for runtime dynamic rendering. In the end, I replaced contentlayer2 with `next/mdx`, which completely replaces mdx with static pages during the compilation phase.

For more details, refer to [Markdown and MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx).

### 7. Use Bundle Analyzer to Reduce Bundle Size

One issue arises when enabling edge runtime for dynamic pages, as some large client dependencies may inadvertently enter the runtime's dependency tree:

```ts
│ __next-on-pages-dist__/functions/search/[id].func.js                │ esm  │ 8995.45 KiB │
```

For instance, the size of the search page can reach around 8 MB. By analyzing the bundle, we identified two large client packages: `@babel/standalone` and `heic2any`.

We addressed this by dynamically importing these packages, enabling lazy loading and singleton instantiation, which reduced the overall project size from 25 MB to just 2 MB.

### 8. Use Cloudflare Image Loader

Integrating Cloudflare's Image Loader is straightforward. Follow the steps outlined in [Cloudflare Image Transform integration with Next.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/integrate-with-frameworks/). The core steps include:

1. Defining `imageLoader.ts` in your code.
2. Enabling Cloudflare's image transformation service for your domain [Cloudflare Image Transform Image](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/get-started/).

### 9. Domain Binding and Redirection

The domain binding and redirection settings differ between Cloudflare Pages and Vercel. For a Pages project, you need to bind both the www and root domains to the Pages project. Then, use Cloudflare's built-in redirection rules to redirect the www domain to the root domain.
