## 3 Hybrid AI Search Combining Local Knowledge Base with the Internet

Often, when we need to find an answer to a question, we first search our local bookmarks, notes, and documents.

If unsuccessful, we turn to the internet or consult AI large models for answers. This traditional method is comparatively inefficient.

MemFree aims to achieve a one-click implementation of hybrid search combining the local knowledge base with the internet, utilizing AI large models to filter, evaluate, and summarize the best answer.
