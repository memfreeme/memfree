When I build [AhaApple](https://www.ahaapple.com/), I use Google Workspace to manage the domain email, which cost 7.20$ each month, but when I build Memfree, I want to find a free domain email service, because I only need to domain email to send and reveice emails.

## Why I Choose the Zoho Email

1. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Zoho Email has the Forever Free Plan, Up to five users, 5GB/User, which is enough for startup
2. **Accessibility Across Devices:** Zoho Email has the Web and mobile apps both, which is convenient
3. **User-Friendly Configuration:** Zoho Email config is very easy


## Why not Google Workspace

Because I want to reduce the startup cost.


I will continue to update this post as I gain more experience and discoveries.
