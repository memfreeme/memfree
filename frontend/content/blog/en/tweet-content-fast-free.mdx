At the beginning, I used https://jina.ai/reader/ to convert any web page into markdown format, split it and store it in the vector database

## The issues of Jina Reader

I found two issues with indexing Twitter content:

1. Jina Reader returns a lot of useless information, you can refer to https://r.jina.ai/https://x.com/ahaapple2023/status/1816118637696279006
2. Jina Reader has a high latency, **occasionally up to 1 minute**, and most of the time it takes 1 or 2 seconds

## How to get tweet content fast and free

### 1 Use Twitter API

which is too expensive.

### 2 Use Exa API

```ts
import Exa from 'exa-js';

const exa = new Exa('API_TOKEN');

const result = await exa.getContents(
    ['https://x.com/ahaapple2023/status/1816118637696279006'],
    {
        text: true,
    },
);
```

This is faster, but costs $1 for every 1,000 requests, and only displays plain text content. I also need to return the image associated with each tweet.

### 3. Use cdn.syndication.twimg.com API

https://cdn.syndication.twimg.com/tweet-result?id=1818291443049615786&lang=en&features=tfw_timeline_list%3A%3Btfw_follower_count_sunset%3Atrue%3Btfw_tweet_edit_backend%3Aon%3Btfw_refsrc_session%3Aon%3Btfw_fosnr_soft_interventions_enabled%3Aon%3Btfw_show_birdwatch_pivots_enabled%3Aon%3Btfw_show_business_verified_badge%3Aon%3Btfw_duplicate_scribes_to_settings%3Aon%3Btfw_use_profile_image_shape_enabled%3Aon%3Btfw_show_blue_verified_badge%3Aon%3Btfw_legacy_timeline_sunset%3Atrue%3Btfw_show_gov_verified_badge%3Aon%3Btfw_show_business_affiliate_badge%3Aon%3Btfw_tweet_edit_frontend%3Aon&token=6c2mmul6mnh

You could change the id to the tweet id you want to get.

**The interface is fast and free. The react-tweet library uses this interface**

Below is my implementation of extracting tweet text and images. You are welcome to give a star

### 4. Use document.title In chrome extension

Finally, I found that **the fastest, easiest, free, and unlimited method is document.title**.

In the Chrome extension, you can directly get document.title. Its content is the same as the text content you get through `cdn.syndication.twimg.com`

You could refer to https://github.com/memfreeme/memfree/blob/main/extention/public/inject.js#L68

### 5. Use the puppeteer and puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

When we found that document.title can get the text content of Twitter, a natural idea is to crawl this web page and get the title.

It should be noted that using puppeteer directly in headless mode does not work. We need to use `puppeteer-extra` and `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` to simulate real user requests.

The sample code is as follows:

```ts
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-extra';
import StealthPlugin from 'puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth';

puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());

(async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.setUserAgent(
        'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
    );
    await page.setViewport({ width: 1280, height: 800 });

    await page.goto('https://x.com/ahaapple2023/status/1818291443049615786', {
        waitUntil: 'networkidle2',
        timeout: 60000,
    });

    await page.waitForSelector('title');
    const title = await page.title();
    console.log(title);
    await browser.close();
})();
```
